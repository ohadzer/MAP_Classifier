# MAP_Classifier

The Data Story
In a faraway land called Randomistan there is a rare animal called the Randomammal.
Scientists gathered data about this unique animal to help the randomian researchers in observing this beast.
For a 1000 days straight they have measured the temperature and the humidity in Randomistan and whether the Randomammal was spotted or not.

The dataset contains 2 features (Temperature, Humidity) alongside a binary label (Spotted) for each instance.

I'm going to test 2 different classifiers :
Naive Bayes Classifier
Full Bayes Classifier.
In both cases I will assume that our features are normally distributed. Naive classifier will assume that the features are independent, and Full Bayes classifier will not make this assumption.

In this project I  performed the following:Â¶
1. Implement a Naive Bayeas Classifier based on Multi Normal distribution
2. Implement a Full Bayes Classifier based on Multi-Normal distribution
3. Implement a Distcrete Naive Bayes Classifier.
